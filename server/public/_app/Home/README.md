# Welcome!

## About

This website was created byt Hunter and Peyton to help share and spread some ideas and knowledge that we have while doing personal projects

## This website

This website is created entirely with JavaScript. The front-end (what you see here) is created with Reactjs and the backend is node.js. Both of us like programming so it did not make sense to use someone elses programming project to share all our projects.

## History

In 2016, our neigbor offered to make a website for our little photography buisness. He at the time was an IT Manager for the local hospital and had the resources to do so.
